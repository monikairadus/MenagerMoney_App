# Menager Money

This application allows you to effectively manage your expenses. In the right panel there is the "Add transaction" button, after which a panel appears where you can create a new transaction. Here it is possible to define a specific category for expenses, e.g. shopping or cinema. Depending on whether the transaction is on the expenditure or income side, after saving it goes to the appropriate field in the "List of transactions" panel. On this basis, the funds available in the right panel are automatically calculated. There is also the option to delete expenses in the transaction lists as well as the ability to choose the style in which the application is to be displayed.
